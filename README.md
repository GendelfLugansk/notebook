# Summary

Just a notebook animation. As it uses some modern techniques, here is a list of browsers where 
it's supposed to work:
* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari (on Os X)
* Microsoft Edge

Will not work in Internet Explorer, as it does not support ``transform-style: preserve-3d;``. Who uses
IE in 2017, anyway?

# Develop & Build

I use gulp to build this demo. To do this, you will need:

* Install recent node and npm
* Install gulp: ``npm install --global gulp-cli``
* Run ``npm install`` from project's directory to install dependencies
* Run ``gulp`` to build site and start local web-server or ``gulp compile`` just to build
